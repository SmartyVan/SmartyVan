Just a mobile smart home automation nerd with a Van, a laptop, and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SmartyVan).

There are literally **DOZENS** of us.

Check out the [Smarty Van Discord](https://discord.gg/3rqeqES3zP) if you are one of us.

Also, enjoy these open source mobile smart home software and hardware [projects](https://smartyvan.github.io/Community-Projects/) created by members of the community.
